# Vehicle Maps

## What is a Vehicle Map

A vehicle map is an image of the vehicle that has interactive clickable elements overlaid on them that will allow the users to view records that are tied to those elements via tags.

## Creating Vehicle Maps

### Useful Resources:

- [Base64-Image](https://www.base64-image.de/) for converting images to base64
- [Image-Map](https://www.image-map.net/) for creating coordinates
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for generating color templates

### Template

```
{
	"ImageLink": "",
	"Height": 0,
	"Width": 0,
	"Map": [
		{
			"Tags": "",
			"Coordinates": "",
			"Color": "#",
			"Opacity": 0.5
		},
		{
			"Tags": "",
			"Coordinates": "",
			"Color": "#",
			"Opacity": 0.5
		}
	]
}
```

- ImageLink refers to the Base64 encoded image, but you can also put a link in there that points to an image
- Height refers to the height of the image
- Width refers to the width of the image
- Map.Tags refers to the tags, separated by an empty space that the records should be filtered with
- Map.Coordinates refers to the coordinates of the points generated by an image map creator
- Map.Color refers to the color of the overlay
- Map.Opacity refers to the opacity of the overlay(values range from 0.0 to 1.0, 0.0 is completely transparent and 1.0 is completely opaque)
- Trailing Commas are not supported and must be truncated
