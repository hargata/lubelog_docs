## Donating via Stripe

[Donate via Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/aEU9Egc8DdMc9bO144)

Donating via Stripe allows you to fund specific features using the "Issue #" Field, but your name won't be displayed under the sponsors section. This method is ideal if you wish to maintain anonymity.

The "Issue #" corresponds to the ticket number of the GitHub Issue

Funding specific issues help us prioritize which issue to focus our development effort on.

### Disclaimer

There are no guarantees that a feature will be delivered just because funding has been allocated to it, especially in the event that there are other features that are better funded.

Sponsors are updated at midnight Mountain Time daily, if you recently became a sponsor, please check back the next day to see if your name now shows up.
